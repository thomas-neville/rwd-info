<!--
Code a single page website. It must contain an explanation of the problems that responsive web design solves, in your own words (150 words or more). Additionally, it should have a form for visitors to request more information. The form must have at least four types of inputs (text, number, radio buttons, etc), two required fields, some styling (Bootstrap or custom). The entire page must be valid HTML, of course. Since we didn't get to form styling in class, you only need to do the bare minimum- either include Bootstrap and let it work its magic, or write just one or two CSS rules to improve the form's appearance. There are resources about form styling in the Lesson 01 Overview page. 

 

The content of the form (questions asked) is up to you, but it should make sense in the context of the page. Suggestions: "how many unique visitors does your website receive daily?", "what would you like to accomplish with a website redesign?" 

 

Create a Github repository with Pages hosting for the site, and submit a link to the live page for this assignment.

 

Extra Challenge: Have one form field use the “pattern” attribute to match it against a regular expression.-->

    <!-- This section is my explanation for what Responsive Web Design does and the problems it solves -->
    <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) adjusts the content of a webpage based on the display or window size of the device viewing it. These adjustments make the content easier to view and can also improve navigation. For example, a webpage may have several columns of text and pictures spanning horizontally that can be easily read and seen on a large desktop monitor. When the same page is viewed on a smartphone the text and images will shrink down to fit on the smaller screen of the phone making it difficult to see. Responsive Web Design solves this by resizing and reorganizing the content with things like breakpoints. Breakpoints are set to resize or move the content based on the window's height and width. In the case of this webpage with columns of text and pictures, it might mean stacking the columns of content vertically so the text and images are a more appropriate size for the width of the device. A website with content built for a mobile device often scales to larger screen sizes more easily than larger content would scale down.</p>
  
    <p>Responsive Web Design can also be used to make navigation easier. A common solution for consolidating a horizontal navigation bar is to change it to a dropdown menu like a "hamburger" menu. If a navigation bar has too many links and displays horizontally your site's visitor may have trouble reading or clicking on the intended navigation link.</p>

    <p>Image resolution should also be considered when creating a Responsive Web Design. High resolution images can mean longer load times and may move other content that loads faster if they are not designated space beforehand. This can be frustrating for your site's visitor if they begin reading or viewing the content that loaded first. Responsive Web Design should adjust image sizes as the window is resized and not snap to a new resolution.</p>

    <p>There are many other characteristics of a Responsive Web Design and more will be introduced in the future. For questions or suggestions about this information, contact me through the form below:</p>
