<!--
Code a single page website. It must contain an explanation of the problems that responsive web design solves, in your own words (150 words or more). Additionally, it should have a form for visitors to request more information. The form must have at least four types of inputs (text, number, radio buttons, etc), two required fields, some styling (Bootstrap or custom). The entire page must be valid HTML, of course. Since we didn't get to form styling in class, you only need to do the bare minimum- either include Bootstrap and let it work its magic, or write just one or two CSS rules to improve the form's appearance. There are resources about form styling in the Lesson 01 Overview page. 

 

The content of the form (questions asked) is up to you, but it should make sense in the context of the page. Suggestions: "how many unique visitors does your website receive daily?", "what would you like to accomplish with a website redesign?" 

 

Create a Github repository with Pages hosting for the site, and submit a link to the live page for this assignment.

 

Extra Challenge: Have one form field use the “pattern” attribute to match it against a regular expression.-->
